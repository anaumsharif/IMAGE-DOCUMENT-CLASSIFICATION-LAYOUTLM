# IMAGE-DOCUMENT-CLASSIFICATION-LAYOUTLM  

This repository contains a project implementing **LayoutLM**, a pre-trained model designed for **document image classification**. LayoutLM effectively combines **visual features, layout, and text content** to classify and analyze documents, making it an excellent choice for tasks such as invoice processing, form understanding, and document automation.

## üöÄ Features  
- **Pretrained Model Integration**: Utilizes LayoutLM for document classification.  
- **Document Understanding**: Combines layout, visual, and textual features.  
- **Custom Training**: Fine-tuned on a dataset of labeled document images.  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Extendable to different use cases such as OCR, invoice processing, and more.
