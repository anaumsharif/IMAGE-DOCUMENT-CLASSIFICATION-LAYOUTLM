# Resume Classification using LayoutLM for Image-Document Classification  

This project leverages **LayoutLM (Multimodal)**, a pre-trained transformer model, to develop an automated **Resume Classification System**. The model processes resumes in image or PDF format, classifies them into predefined categories (e.g., Software Engineer, Data Scientist, Marketing Specialist), and extracts key information such as skills, experience, and contact details.

## üìä Use Case  

This project is ideal for:  
1. **HR and Recruitment Teams**: To automatically categorize and filter resumes based on job requirements.  
2. **Job Portals**: For resume parsing and classification into job-specific categories.  
3. **Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS)**: To enhance search and match capabilities by tagging resumes with roles.

## üö¶ Workflow  

1. **Input Resumes**: Accept resumes in image or PDF format.  
2. **Preprocessing**: Extract features (text, layout, and visual) using LayoutLM Multimodal.  
3. **Classification**: Use a fine-tuned LayoutLM model to classify resumes into predefined categories.  
4. **Output**: Return the classification result and optionally the extracted information.

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation  

### 1. **Input Formats**  
- Supported: PDF, JPEG, PNG, TIFF  
- Input resumes should be clean and legible to ensure accurate classification.  

### 2. **Preprocessing**  
- OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is used to extract text from images or PDFs.  
- Layout and visual embeddings are combined for robust feature extraction.  

### 3. **Model**  
- The **LayoutLM Multimodal model** is fine-tuned on a dataset of resumes.  
- Classifies resumes into categories like:  
  - Data Scientist  
  - Software Engineer  
  - Project Manager  
  - Marketing Specialist  

### 4. **Evaluation Metrics**  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score are used to evaluate model performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Use  

1. **Prepare the Dataset**  
   - Collect resumes categorized by job roles.  
   - Ensure the dataset contains a mix of layouts and formats.  

2. **Train the Model**  
   - Fine-tune LayoutLM on the labeled resume dataset.  

3. **Predict and Classify**  
   - Use the model to classify new resumes and extract information.
